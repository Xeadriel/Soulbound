1st Dungeon
- tribal orc/goblin with nature magic
- 8-12 rooms
- at around half the rooms: dungeon item
- dungeon keys, 
- exploration and loot
- mini boss for item



Combat mechanic idea:
- when attack would hit, generous time to press button, which creates a tight quick action 2-4 buttons to press in sequence quickly. Success: block, fail: get hit

player attack combos:
	- player 1: 2x 3 hit combos, 
		- one light, (slash slash stab)
		- one heavy and slow but more range (stab, wide slash, wide slash)
	- player 2:
		- light, (pew pew pew, mini cool down, pew pew pew ...)
		- heavy, charges as long as pew pew pew + mini cooldown, but then shoots 5 at once then minibreak


Item ideas:
- chalice of life (uses enemy blood, once filled, can be thrown grows plants)

- chalice revives by going to underworld and fighting your way out, show that in tutorial by having them die
